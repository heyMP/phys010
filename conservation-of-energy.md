 Let us explore conservation of energy further with the example of a skater in the "Energy Skate Park" below.

When she is up the ramp, she has some amount of gravitational potential energy. This is energy that can potentially be released into kinetic energy via the action of gravity (the skater is attracted downward). As she reaches the bottom of the ramp, she will convert that energy from gravitational potential to kinetic energy. 
 
As you play with the simulation, make sure to toggle the pie chart and the bar chart to see how energy is converted from kinetic to gravitational potential energy.

Conservation of energy is the statement that the total energy (gold bar in the sim) of the whole system remains constant in a closed system. The total energy remains the same but note how the energy change form between kinetic and potential.

You can also include friction - click on the friction button at the bottom. In this case, the skater eventually stops after all the kinetic and gravitational potential energy has been converted to thermal energy. (The contact between the wheels and the ramp causes heat and dissipates the energy in the system.)

Energy of the whole system is still conserved, though, even with friction. The energy is transferred to thermal energy. It is then completely useless—and unusable—to the skater and motion stops.

** Make sure to play with the simulations; we will come back to this** 

### Energy Bar Diagram. 

Energy is conserved but it can change its form. To understand the dynamic of a system, it is useful to make a list of the various form of energy and to represent the amount of energy in each category by a bar. As the system evolve in time, the energy goes from one form to another but the total should always be the same (assuming no transfer in or out of the system).

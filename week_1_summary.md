### Numbers and Units

- a nanometer is $10^{-9}$ m and atoms are about 0.1 nm in size.
- there are $10^{23}$ atoms in a mole and this is more than the numbers of stars in our galaxy!
- When you multiply two numbers in exponential notation you add the exponents. $10^{23} \times 10^{-10}$ gives $10^{23-10}= 10^{13}$.
- We will use SI units of meters, second and kilogram.

### Atomic Theory

- Atoms are small, numerous, ageless and move around constantly.
- Brownian motion refers to the random motion of large particles when atoms constantly hit them.

### Structure of Atoms

- Atoms are made of protons (+ 1 electric charge) and neutrons (0 charge) surrounded by electrons (-1 negative charge).
- Atoms are mostly just made of void or nothing.

### Elements

- Each element in the periodic table has an atomic number, which is the number of protons. Change the number of protons and you change the element.

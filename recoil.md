Momentum like energy is a conserved quantity and a good example is recoil.

Imagine a cannon, loaded with cannon ball, at rest on the fortification. The initial speed (as seen from somebody also at rest) is zero and therefore the system

Cannon + cannonball

Has zero momentum $p=mv = m\times 0 = 0$. After ignition, the cannon ball of mass $m_b$ is shot with velocity $v_b$. 

> Subscripts are often used in physics to label the various parts of the system, here b = ball and c = cannon

Since no momentum can be created or destroyed and since nobody from outside came to push the ball, it must be that the system cannon + cannon ball still has zero momentum. The total momentum is conserved and must not have changed. 

This means that the cannon must recoil with equal momentum that the ball took with it

As you can see from the figure above. We must have that

$p_b +p_c = 0$

This is what recoil is. We started with zero momentum, we split the system int two parts and one move left (say), the other must move right with a momentum equal in magnitude (but opposite in direction). 

** Note a couple of important things** 

1. for the two momenta to add to zero, one of them must be negative of the other. They must be in opposite direction
2. While the cannon and the cannon ball must have equal magnitude of momenta (same number but different signs), they do not have the same speed! Momenta is mass times speed and because the cannon has a much bigger mass it will have a much lower speed.

I would like to emphasize one part of the academic integrity principle of Penn State about plagiarism.

Of course all the academic integrity principles are important (like cheating) but plagiarism is the most misunderstood. Students may plagiarize without even being aware of it and this is still a violation of academic principles.

### Examples of Plagiarism

Lets first start with some example of plagiarism

1. Submit a paper for grading that you did not write yourself
2. Copy answers or text from a colleague and submit is as your own
3. Quote or paraphrase from another paper without giving credit to the author
4. Cite data without giving credit to the original source
5. Propose someone else’s idea as if it were yours
6. Fabricate or use incorrect references
7. Submit another’s presentation, program or spreadsheet with only small changes

These are pretty clear cut violations of Penn State academic principles. What about the following case?

**How to avoid this.** Be careful at how you take notes!!

### Consequences of Plagiarism

In the real world, you can get sued, lose your job or lose your reputation. You can find on this Wikipedia [page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_plagiarism_incidents) many famous examples of plagiarism with very often dire consequences for the person who did it.

For students at Penn State, **plagiarism will** result sanctions. For more on academic integrity see http://science.psu.edu/current-students/Integrity/Policy.html 

### External Resources

- Wikipedia is the main source of plagiarism (and the easiest to spot). Here is a **very good** video from the PSU library: [How to use Wikipedia](https://www.libraries.psu.edu/psul/tutorials/wikipedia.html).

## Lesson Objectives

The objectives for this lesson are that by the end of the week you will be able to

* LOPW02: note the similarities between various wave phenomena such as sound and light. 
* LOPW03: employ correctly the relation between wavelength, frequency and speed of a wave.
* LOPW04: describe the basic features of the sound wave.
* LOPW05	understand how speed of sound can change and how this can lead to bending of wave.
* 
LOPW06: determine the result of interference between two waves such as in the double slit experiment

Good work on week 1! You have now seen the first building block of nature.

**All the matter around us is made of atoms that can bind together or just move around freely.**



### Energy

The next building block is more abstract but very important, it is the concept of energy. This is one of those things that is hard to describe but you know it when you see it.  
  
If atoms and matter are the substance of the universe you could say **that energy is the mover of substance**. Before going into definitions, let us look at examples that you know.

### Molecular Bonds

The world is made of atoms but very often these atoms are actually stuck together into molecules. Some of those molecules are simple like water but others like DNA are absolutely huge!

Atoms like to bind together for energetic reasons. They like to exchange their electrons. An important famous molecule is water which is made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Carbon-dioxide is made of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.

Look at the label (Fig 1) of a soda can. This soda contains a huge amount of atoms in the form mostly of water, sugar, and sodium. But it also contains 240 Calories. This is energy.

When you drink this soda, you will be able to get 240 Calories of energy by breaking the molecular bonds in the sugar that your body uses as a fuel.

But what is energy really?

The formal definition of **energy** is **that which allows you to do work**, while **work** itself is defined as **a force over a distance**. We will return to that definition at the end of the lesson. Another good definition of **energy** is **anything that can be turned into thermal energy, which is what raises the temperature of a thermometer**. Again, its easier with examples; you don’t have to memorize the definitions.

### Check Out this Spring!

Let's say I compress the spring in the figure by putting a box on top it. The spring when compressed will have stored energy in it. The spring has the ability to do work in moving the box over a certain distance; we say it has _potential_ energy. **_It has the potential of moving the box if the spring is released._** Where did the energy came from? I put it there by doing work on the spring by compressing it. I got the energy by eating my breakfast this morning, etc. . . Energy just moves around from one place to the next, and it makes things want to move.

- S: Are you saying that the energy in the compressed spring is the same energy as in food?
- M: Yes. The energy in food is chemical energy between the atoms and molecules that make the food. You can think of molecules as having little compressed springs between each atom. Your body, via chemical reactions, breaks the bonds between molecules and the energy is released and used to move your muscles.

One of the most important concepts of physics is that **“Energy is conserved”**. Energy is continuously transferred from one system to another but the amount of energy remains constant.

The concept of energy is crucial both in your everyday life and in the most recent advances in physics and technology.

Before we examine the various forms of energy in more details, it is important to get an idea of scale and numbers.

## Welcome to Phys 010: Physics Behind the Headlines!

In the weekly lessons, you will often see many discussions between Sophie and Marie. Sophie is a virtual student at Penn State and just like you she is super interested in learning physics and she is full of questions. Marie is a successful (but still virtual :) graduate student in physics who will try to answer all of Sophie's questions.

- Sophie: Hi there everybody! As this class is online you cannot ask questions in the lecture. But I am a virtual person...
- Marie: Just like me.
- S: So I can interrupt and ask questions.
- M: actually I have a question.
- S: But wait, you are the know-it all instructor! I am the one who ask the questions.
- M: Normally yes, but let me start with the first question.
- S: I have feeling I will not know the answer.
- M: So you said we are virtual people. That must mean we exist as bytes of 0 and 1 on a computer.
- S: I am already lost...
- M: Here is my question, could we have a soul or are we just machines?
- S: ...I thought this was a class about science not a philosophy class about souls.
- M: Yeah I know.... but just wondering...

This story is discussed at length in your book as well: Ch. 7, pp 239-260.

This is a pretty neat story. Here is a very short summary:

In 1947, devices that the US government called flying disks crashed in New Mexico. Debris were collected by the army at the Roswell Army Air Base which was one of the most highly classified facilities in the US. The government said flying disks and this is the headline you just saw.

The next day, the US government retracted the press release; they said they were mistaken at first. What had fallen was now supposed to be weather balloons. It was very obvious it was not a weather balloon to anybody who had seen the debris. The government was lying, and conspiracy theories still exist to this day that the flying disk was actually a UFO.

It is true that the government was lying. It was covering up a secret program called "Project Mogul."

## Sound Channel

From your readings, try to answer the following questions.

One way to see that waves bend on the slow side is to imagine that a wave is just a marching band with each row of the band representing a crest of the wave. As the band marches, all members in a given crest try to stay in line. If one side slows down, the other side will need to turn in order to keep a straight line.

## SOFAR 

As we saw, the speed of sound is determined by the speed of molecules or atoms in the medium. In a liquid or gas, there can be two competing effects to change the speed of sound:

1. Lower temperature means lower speed.
2. Increased pressure means higher speed.

If you look at the ocean, the temperature decreases as you go down in depth, but the pressure increases. The two effects compete against each other and there is a minimum speed.

This is the sound channel in the ocean. Sound tends to get focused and trapped in this channel, and it will travel for miles before being dissipated. The SOFAR program is a military program to rescue downed pilots and it uses the ocean sound channel. Whales also use this sound channel to communicate over long distances.

A similar sound channel exists in the atmosphere. At high enough altitude, the temperature of the air in the atmosphere goes up because it is heated by the sun's rays. The pressure on the other hand goes down the higher you go. This competition creates a sound channel in the atmosphere where there is a minimum in the speed of sound.

### Project Mogul 

The answer to Roswell (at least if you want to believe the most recent explanation) is that the 1947 flying saucer was really a big disk microphone (like Gandhi is using below circa 1940 but bigger). This was the "flying disk" and it was flying high up in the atmosphere since it was stationed in the sound channel in the hope of detecting Russia's nuclear tests. This was a top secret program and it worked with the US detecting the first of Russia's nuclear tests in 1949.

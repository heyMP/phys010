Now is a good time to pause and discuss units. Physical quantities are described by a number followed by a unit of measurement. In scientific discussion, you cannot just give answers with numbers, you need to specify the unit.

If we ask you how much energy there is in your soda can and you answer 1... we then wait ... and follow by 1 what?

It could be 1 Joule, 1 Calorie or maybe 1 orange worth of energy? 1 is not an answer, you need a unit. 

Units are often abbreviated. For example a second becomes s. 

> Usain Bolt ran the race in 9.69 s

We can also modify the units by adding a prefix. Here is a list of common prefixes that can be added to any unit to decrease or increase its value by the corresponding factor (expressed in scientific notation)
 
| name | abbreviation | factor  
| --------------------
| pico | p | $10^{-12}$
| nano | n | $10^{-9}$
| micro | $\mu$ | $10^{-6}$
| milli | m | $10^{-3}$
| centi | c | $10^{-2}$
| kilo | k | $10^{3}$
| mega | M | $10^{6}$
| giga | G | $10^{9}$


> Usain Bolt ran the 100 m race. This is the same as the 0.1 km (0.1 kilometer) race. 

### Different units for the same thing

Over time, physicists have invented many different units for the same physical quantities. 

The horsepower is the typical power (energy per time) of a working horse. The unit is abbreviated by hp. It is often used to measure power output of engines instead of the more standard Watt (W) for electricity.

1 hp = 745 W

Here are other well-known unit conversions between inch (in), miles (mi) and meters (m)

* 1 in = 2.54 cm
* 1 mi = 1609 km

All three units in, mi and m represents **the same physical quantity of length**. They are just different measurement standard. 

In science, we need to choose a set of units and stick to it in order to not be constantly confused.  The standard currently used is the SI unit (for Systeme International). 

Here are the SI units we have seen up to this point in this class. 

| SI unit | abbreviation | physical quantity represented  
| --------------------
| second | s | time
| meter | m | length
| gram | g | mass
| joule | J | energy
| watt | W | power


> You still need to know about other (non SI) units like the Calorie. You do not need to remember that a Calorie is 4184 Joules, but you need to know that a Calorie is a unit of measurement for the physical quantity known as energy.

### Creating new units from old ones.

Many units can be expressed in term of others. The easiest example that we have just seen is the unit for power the Watt. 

Since power = energy/time, it means that 

1 Watt = 1 Joule/second  (pronounced 1 Joule _per_ second). One can say that a lightbulb is rated at 60 W or it is rated at 60 J/s. These are equivalent ways of stating the same physical quantity. 

Another well known example is speed which is in m/s (meters per second). We do not have a special name for it, we just always express speed in m/s or km/h or mi/h. The last one is often written as mph (miles per hour).  

> note that hour (h) is not a SI unit and must be converted to second 1 h = 3600 s

Finally, one can go in reverse. If power = energy/time, we can also write that 

 energy = power * time
 
Instead of saying we have 1 Joule of energy, we can say we have 1 Ws (pronounced 1 Watt second).  We can use Wh (watt hour) or kWh (kiloWatt hour). Because these are units of power multiplied by units of time, the result are units of energy. 

Finally at the end of this page, we get to the kWh which is the unit of energy used in your bills at home by power companies. It is almost a SI unit (the kilo-Watt part) but not quite since hour is not a SI unit, it should be second. It is a unit of **energy** not power! This is what you buy from power from power companies, you buy energy which is a real countable physical quantity just like mass.

Energy is not the only thing that is conserved in the world. There is another quantity that all particles have; it is called momentum (momenta is the plural form).
 
We use the letter $p$ to denote momentum. And just like energy, it is a law of physics that the **total momentum of a system is conserved.** Before we look at that statement in more details you should first examine the following picture of swinging balls.

This is called "Newton's cradle." (And the reason why science teachers should never be put on playground duty...) Look closely at the collision. When a ball hits the stack, the ball at the other end picks up and continues the movement. It looks like something is transmitted. Well, there is something "transmitted" and it is not just energy. In this kind of collision, momentum is conserved and the ball at the other end has the same momentum as the ball that just hit had.

So what is momentum? Fundamentally, momentum and energy are very related. We talked previously about how energy is the ability to make things move. Well, momentum is the ability to change the movement, the ability to provide an impulse to other objects. The more momentum, the bigger the impulse you can provide. What is happening in Newton's cradle is that each time there is a collision, an impulse is given to the other balls.

There is simple formula for momentum. It is just

$p = mv$

just mass times velocity.

## Speed and Velocity

Great but what is velocity and speed exactly? Are there any differences? 
Yes there is. 

Speed tells you the rate of change of your position as a function of time. When you go at 60 mph on the highway, it means that you travel a distance of 60 miles within 1 hour. Or 120 miles if you travel for two hours at that speed. 

With velocity, we indicate both the speed and the direction of travel. For us in this class, we only move in one dimension with the x-axis pointing right (see back to week 1).

If a car has a speed of 60 mph moving right we will say that it has a velocity of 

$v = + 60 \;\rm{mph}$

where the + (positive) sign indicates that the car is moving right. If it moves left, we say that it has a velocity of 

$v = -60\; \rm{mph}$

where the minus sign indicates that motion is to the left. 

> Velocity is the same number as the speed but with a sign in front to indicate direction. Positive is motion to the right and negative to the left (this is a convention). If the sign is positive, it is very often omitted. It is usually understood that if the quantity has no sign in front, the quantity is positive.

## Momentum

To continue the car example, let us imagine that your car has a mass of 1000 kg. Let us say you are moving to the right at a speed of 60 mph. First, we should convert that number to SI units (you can google for this, there is not test/HW questions asking you to do this). After looking it up, you find that 60 mph is approximately 25 m/s. 

The momentum of the car if you are moving to the right is 

$$p=mv= (1000\;kg) \times (25\;m/s) = 2500\;kg\;m/s$$

Moving to the left it would be 

$$p=mv= (1000\;kg) \times (-25\;m/s) = -2500\;kg\;m/s$$

There is no special name for the unit of momentum. We just carry the whole kilogram times meters per second (kg m/s) around and yes this is a mouthful.

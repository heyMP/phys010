Isn't it strange that chocolate chip cookies have more "usable energy" than TNT? Why is dynamite so much more dangerous than cookies? The key difference is how fast the energy is released, and this has to do with power. Look at the table below. It has some very interesting numbers.

|Object | Calories | Joules | Compared to TNT | Type of Energy
|--------
|Moving Bullet| 0.01|40 J|0.015|Kinetic
|Computer Battery| 0.1| 400 J|0.15|Electric
|TNT|0.651|2723 J |1| Chemical
|Chocolate Chip Cookies|5|21 kJ| 8| Chemical
|Butter|7|29 kJ|11|Chemical
|Anthracite Coal| 7.2|30 kJ|11|Chemical
|Gasoline|10|42 kJ|15|Chemical
|Asteroid or Meteor (30km/s)|107|450 kJ|165| Kinetic
|Uranium|20 million|84 billion J|30 million|Nuclear

 
The energy per gram is written in different units. You already know the Calorie. We often use the kilowatt-hour abbreviated kWh in our meters outside of our houses. Electric companies sell us energy in kWh. One kWh is 1000 watt-hour (Wh) and we have that approximately   
  
1 Wh = 1 Calorie. (approximately)   
  
Physicists prefer the unit of Joules which is the natural unit to use in their equations.   
  
4200 Joules = 1 Calorie   
3600 Joules = 1 Wh   
  
As you can see from the table, for the same mass of fuel, uranium is the big winner. The energy that is accessible in uranium is the binding energy between neutrons and protons in the nucleus. We will learn more about this in the future but for now it is important to know that nuclear energy is often _much much_ bigger per gram than chemical energy (TNT, cookies) or energy stored in batteries.

* Marie: Do you play a sport, Sophie?
* Sophie: Yes, I play volleyball.
* M: Ah, great example. This is a sport that has more to do with power than energy.
* M: Some sports require a lot of energy constantly, say like running. These are sports of endurance. But volleyball, or say football, often requires very quick bursts of energy release. These sports are not so much about energy, they require high power.

## Power 

Power is the rate of energy release. It is just the amount of energy that you can release over the time it takes to release it.   
  
Power = Energy/Time   
  
Usain Bolt has a high power when he sprints the 100 meters in less than 10 seconds. The unit for power is the Watt. If you have 1 watt-hour of energy that you release in 1 hour, your power is 1 watt (just divide 1-watt-hour by 1 hour).   
  
TNT has less energy per gram than cookies but it has a high power. TNT is made to release its energy very quickly. TNT explodes while chocolate chip cookies require more time to release all their energy.

## How Much Energy and Power? 

Let us see if you can estimate roughly how much energy and power are in this various circumstances.

|Value|Equivalent|Example
|------
|1 watt (W)|1 joule per second|flashlight
|100 watts|100 joules per second|Bright light bulb
|1 horsepower (hp)|1 kilowatt|Typical horse
|20 hp|20 kilowatt|Small automobile
|1 megawatt (1MW)|1 million watts|Electric power for a small town
|1 gigawatt (1 GW)|1 billion watt|Large coal, gas or nuclear power plant.

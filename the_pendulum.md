Before we study waves, we need to start by looking at the basic idea of an **oscillator**. You can get an oscillating behavior (in time) whenever there is a restoring force that wants to continuously bring back the system to equilibrium.

Oscillations are defined by two main quantities: the amplitude and the frequency. The amplitude is a measure of how large the displacement is from equilibrium while the frequency is the number of cycles per second. The unit of frequency is one over second $1/s$ or Hz (Hertz). We often use the period $T=1/f$ which is just the inverse of the frequency. It has units of second(s) and it represents the time for one full oscillation. **Be careful, one full oscillation is one full back and forth.**

A mass oscillating (vibrating) on a spring has a regular frequency. The pendulum swinging back and forth in a grandfather clock is also an oscillator with a specific frequency.

The oscillatory behavior of a pendulum or a mass on a spring can be displayed in a graphical manner as shown below.  Note the axis, time is the horizontal axis.

There is a lot of information that you need to be able to pick up from this graph:

- Amplitude $x_m =\frac12 (x_{max} â€“ x_{min})$
- Period T = time to repeat oscillation (e.g., peak to peak)
- Frequency f = 1/T. This is the number of oscillations per seconds. The units for frequency are Hertz.

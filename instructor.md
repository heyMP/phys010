My name is Louis Leblond. I will introduce myself with more details on our first discussion board. I am looking forward to your introduction there as well. 


## Orientation
Everything you need each week can always be found on the homepage on Canvas. The course is divided into weekly lessons. Each weekly lessons will typically have: 

* List of readings
* Course content webpage. You are currently viewing week 1 of the course content.
* Homework, discussion boards and or Labs (the activities). 

> All weekly assignments are due on Sunday of any given week but there is no reasons to wait till the last minute! As stated in the syllabus, you can drop the lowest score for homework, discussion boards or labs. This is to account for legitimate life emergency that might prevent you from doing the assignments on time. All assignments are on Canvas.
